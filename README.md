# Cheap-Flights-Web-App
This is a web application that I helped create with a team during the 2018 CodeRed Hackathon. The project was a 
challenge by the PROS company.
The objective of the project is to create a user-friendly interface that allows the client to search for the lowest
available plane ticket price for their desired destination. Our goal was to create a website that uses an API to
search for flights and returns desired results and through our struggles looking for that API and learning how to
use it along with other technologies to help us achieve our project objective, we learned a lot outside of the
classroom and felt like we improved, which was one of our main goals coming into this hackathon. We believe that the
new skills that we developed during this hackathon will help us perform efficiently in our professional careers. 
Our next steps include adding a multi-city user interface that takes in desired days of stay at each stop, looking 
up destinations via airport codes, using normal distribution to balance out ticket price and flight time to ensure 
that the cheapest ticket has the shortest travel time, adding cars and hotels API's to allow the client to rent cars 
and hotels at the final destination, and the possibility of using Telegram to transfer all the personal info to the 
website ONCE instead of entering the information each time the client makes a purchase and provide different methods 
of payments including PayPal to provide a smooth and quick purchase process for the client. Part of the PROS challenge
was to add a map into the web application, but in our opinion, adding maps would not be a good idea as it would slow 
the page and cause the website to be pushed down to the bottom in the Google search results without serving any real
purpose.
